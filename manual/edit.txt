This manual introduces the internal text editor in the
CUIDE program.

*Modes*

The internal text editor has four modes: Normal, Insert,
Select and Command. You can determine the current mode
with the line at bottom. Normal mode is the initial mode
of the internal text editor. To switch back to normal
mode from other modes, you can press the ESC key.

In any modes except the command mode, you can move the
cursor by pressing direction keys.

In the normal mode and the select mode, character inputs
will be interpreted as commands.

In the insert mode, typing a character will insert it into
the text at the current cursor position, and pressing
BACKSPACE will delete the character before the current
cursor position.

In the select mode, you can select text for copy and cut 
operations.

In the command mode, you can use some multi-character
commands. After you type the full command, press ENTER
to issue it.
